# Palindromes

A simple palindrome detector. I wrote versions in both python and c# as an excersize.

## Installation/setup

### C#

The solution should work fine out of the box in Visual Studio 2017. If for some reason it doesn't, the only changes I made (besides the content of palindromes.cs and App.configs) to the default console app was to add references to ```System.Web.Extentions``` and ```System.Configiguration```

### Python

The python version depends on the popular [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library, which can be installed via ```python -m pip install requests```.
